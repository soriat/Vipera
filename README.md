# Vipera

This was the first real game I ever coded!

I had about 1-2 years of programming experience when I wrote this so the style
and code is kinda hard to look at. But I LOVE it! I can look back at this
project and see how far I've come :)

Now as you can imagine, the platform this runs on is ancient. Specifically, this
is a java applet.

Here's how to run it:
 1. Download / Update Java JRE
 2. Compile the project `javac *.java`
 3. Run the applet: `appletviewer index.html`

I made it spit our garbage to the terminal to make the thread not freeze.
